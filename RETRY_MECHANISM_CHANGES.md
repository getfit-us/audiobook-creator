# TTS Retry Mechanism Implementation

## Problem

The audiobook generation process was failing when network errors occurred during TTS API calls, such as "peer closed connection without sending complete message body". The original code would skip these failed segments with `continue`, resulting in missing audio parts in the final audiobook.

## Solution

Implemented a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle temporary network failures and ensure no audio segments are lost.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Retry Function (`generate_tts_with_retry`)

- **Location**: `generate_audiobook.py` (lines ~319-418)
- **Features**:
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (2^attempt + random(0,1) seconds)
  - Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 5)
  - Task cancellation support
  - Comprehensive error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
  - Detailed logging of retry attempts

### 2. Retryable Error Detection

The function identifies and retries the following error types:

- `peer closed connection` (the specific error mentioned)
- `connection reset`
- `timeout`
- `network`
- `temporary failure`
- `service unavailable`
- `bad gateway`
- `gateway timeout`
- `connection aborted`
- `connection refused`
- `connection error`
- `read timeout`
- `write timeout`
- `incomplete read`
- `broken pipe`
- `socket error`
- `http error 5` (5xx server errors)
- `internal server error`
- `server error`

### 3. Updated TTS API Calls

Replaced direct TTS API calls in both functions:

#### Single Voice Function

- **Location**: `generate_audio_with_single_voice()`
- **Change**: Replaced the direct `async_openai_client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create()` call with `generate_tts_with_retry()`
- **Error Handling**: Now treats exhausted retries as critical errors that stop processing (preventing missing audio)

#### Multi-Voice Function

- **Location**: `generate_audio_with_multiple_voices()`
- **Change**: Same replacement as single voice function
- **Error Handling**: Same critical error treatment

### 4. Error Handling Philosophy Change

- **Before**: Network errors were skipped with `continue`, causing missing audio segments
- **After**: Network errors are retried up to 5 times, and only critical failures stop processing
- **Result**: No more missing audio segments due to temporary network issues

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Temporary network issues no longer cause missing audio segments
2. **Robustness**: Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the server during issues
3. **Transparency**: Detailed logging shows retry attempts and reasons
4. **Configurability**: Retry count and behavior can be adjusted
5. **Cancellation Support**: Respects task cancellation during retries
6. **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between retryable and permanent errors

## Testing

A test script (`test_retry_mechanism.py`) was created to verify the retry mechanism works correctly with the TTS API.

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are fully backward compatible - existing code will work without modification, but will now benefit from the retry mechanism automatically.
